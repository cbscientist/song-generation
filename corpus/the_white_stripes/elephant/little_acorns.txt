Take all your problems
And rip 'em apart
Carry them off
In a shopping cart
And another thing
You should've known from the start
The problems in hand
Are lighter than at heart
Be like the squirrel, girl
Be like the squirrel
Give it a whirl, girl
Be like the squirrel
And another thing
You have to know in this world
Cut up your hair
Straighten your curls
Well, your problems
Hide in your curls
