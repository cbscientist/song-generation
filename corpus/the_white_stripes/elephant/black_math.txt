Oh, don't you think that I'm bound to react now?
Well, my fingers definitely turning to black now

Yeah, maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, and maybe that'll be nice, yeah

My books are sitting at the top of the stack now
Well, the longer words are really breaking my back now

Yeah, maybe I'll learn to understand
I'm drawing a square with a pencil in hand, yeah

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
Ah, ah, ah

Mathematically turning the page
Unequivocally showing my age
I'm practically center stage
Undeniably earning your wage

Well, maybe I'll put my love on ice
Teach myself, maybe that'll be nice, yeah

Well, listen master, can you answer a question?
Is it the fingers or the brain
That you're teaching the lesson?
Oh, I can't tell ya how proud I am,
I'm writing down things that I don't understand,

Well, maybe I'll put my love on ice
And teach myself, and maybe that'll be nice

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
