One, two, three
Somebody's screaming, looking at the ceiling, oh
Everything's so funny, I don't have any money, oh
People don't even know me, but they know how to show me, oh
Why can't you be nicer to me?
My pride is dying, I think I'm all done lying, oh
Nobody's sharing, so I stop caring, oh
All alone and walking, nobody's talking, oh
Why can't you be nicer to me?
Well, the wind is blowing, where am I going, oh?
Off a bridge and falling, nobody's calling, oh
On the ground and laying, nobody's praying, oh
Why can't you be nicer to me?
