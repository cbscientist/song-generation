I was watching
With one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people tellin' me to move
I got movin' on my mind
I found shelter
In some thoughts turning wheels around
I said thirty-nine times that I love you
To the beauty I had found
Well, it's one, two, three, four
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
I've been thinking
Of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty old road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take
Till we're alone
Sittin' on the front porch of that home
Stompin' our feet on the wooden boards
Never gotta worry 'bout locking the door
Well, it's one, two, three, four
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
It might sound silly
For me to think childish thoughts like these
But I'm so tired of acting tough
And I'm gonna do what I please
Let's get married
In a big cathedral by a priest
'Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
You could say, "I do" at least
Well, it's one, two, three, four
Take the elevator at the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
And it's four, five, six, seven
Grab your umbrella and grab hold of me
'Cause I'm your favorite fella
All they got inside is vacancy
