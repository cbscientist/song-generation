Well, it can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love, hey
Well, sure I'm C.F.K
But you gotta love me
The cost, no man can say
But you gotta love me
Well, I'm sorry but I'm not
Interested in gold mines
Oil wells, shipping or real estate
Yeah, what would I like to have been?
Everything you hate
And it's no trick
To make a lot of money
If all you want
Is to make a lot of money
But you've gotta love me
Yeah, you've gotta love me
Well, it can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
There is no true love
There is a man, a certain man
And for the poor, you may be sure
That he'll do all he can
Who is this one, his favourite son?
Just his action has this traction
Magnets on the run
Who likes to smoke, enjoys a joke
And wouldn't get a bit upset if he were really broke
With wealth and fame
He's still the same
And I'll bet you five you're not alive
If you don't know his name
You said, "The union forever"
You scream "The union forever"
You cried "The union forever"
But that was untrue, girl
'Cause it can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love
