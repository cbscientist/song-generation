I am as ugly as I seem
Worse than all your dreams
Could ever make me out to be
And it makes me want to scream
When it's Halloween
And the kids are laughing at me
The rogue is a bank he's never broke
But worth as much as a joke
That no one is laughing at
Can you believe some things are not?
Appealing and there's a snot
On the ceiling of my childhood bedroom
And of these dreams that you can't imagine
But none of them match the vision
That you have decided for me
You want to take away from me
Things that are mine and it's not your right
I'll bet you wouldn't expect a fight
Can it be that I don't want what you want?
But the only thing I could care for
Is a place in a home that is safe and warm
Safe and warm, safe and warm, safe and warm
It's alright
You want to take away from me
Things that are mine and it's not your right
I'll bet you wouldn't expect a fight
Can it be that I don't want what you want?
Can it be so simple?
Can it be so simple to me?
There is a drop of blood on the ground
And it seems to me that it's not my kind
And I can't be sure if it's yours or mine
Can it be that I don't want what you want?
That I don't want what you want?
That I don't want what you want?
I am as ugly as I seem
Worse than all your dreams
Could ever make me
Out to be
Out to be
Out to be
